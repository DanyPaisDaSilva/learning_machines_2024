NOTES FOR TASK 2
# Randomize the object generation (through lua)
# Randomize the starting point OR 1000 steps in one arena, then 1000 in another arena, etc etc

# Reality vs Simulation
Add noise to the simulated camera to help with reality adjustment
Randomize the camera orientation slightly

# Reward function:
The center of the object should be as close as possible.
-> what if there are two objects? steer to the closest one (largest area)

Multiplying the different objectives: robot pays equal attention to both
Adding the different objectives: robot can do one or the other independently

## What do we reward?
- Finding new greens
- The DIFFERENCE in green area, vs one frame and the next

# Image processing:
Use OpenCV
Normalize image dimensions!
Filter for green, use HSV
Try to find the center of the object


TASK FLOWCHART
- Search for objects
- Move to the closest object (the closest being the largest sized mask)
- Collide with it! (move forward until it disappears)
- If you do not see green, reward the robot for turning (UNTIL green is seen, then punish staying in place)
